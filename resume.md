### I build software.
I have been hacking since I was literally 12 years old. I have approximately 10 years of programming experience.<br>
I've written a wide array of software — micro services, full-stack web applications, Unix command-line utilities, advanced algorithms work, silly scripts, you name it.

### I  open source.
All my personal projects are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html">free software</a>, as defined by the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.fsf.org/">FSF</a>, ensuring a user's four fundamental freedoms:
0. The freedom to run the program as you wish, for any purpose.
1. The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish.
2. The freedom to redistribute copies (so you can help your neighbour!)
3. The freedom to distribute copies of modified versions to others; by doing this, others can benefit from your changes 

### I write code.
I'm proficient in the following programming languages, and familiar with many more:<br>
`PHP`, `Python`, `C/C++`, and `Shell`, `JavaScript`, `HTML / CSS`, `SQL`

### I am a total Unix nerd.
As in software development: I tend to prefer the Unix principles of software design.<br>
As in operating systems: Microsoft makes me sad. I know the ins- and outs- of Linux. My first Linux was Arch — I installed it myself when I was 13. My current Linux is Arch, and I've stuck with that for about year now.<br>
I also have a whackload of experience administrating various Debian/Ubuntu servers.

### I am a digital rights activist.
I'm a vocal supporter of Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) and Free Software Foundation (FSF) initiatives. As a hacker and computer scientist, my goal has always been to make meaningful change through technology — I spend a lot of time thinking about how to do that. I think a lot of data is scary, and constantly challenge its collection and usage. Ethical, privacy-oriented technology makes my heart happy.

### I am currently located in and around Belgorod, Russia.
